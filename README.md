# React State Management Counter

This project series demonstrates different approaches to **state management in React** by building an interactive counter app.  
We start with `useState`, then progress to **Context API** and **Redux**, showcasing how to manage and share state across components.

## 🚀 Learning Objectives
- Understand React state with `useState`
- Implement global state using **Context API**
- Master **Redux** for complex scenarios
- Compare different state management solutions
- Apply state persistence and single source of truth
- Structure apps for scalable state management

## 📦 Requirements
- **Node.js** v14+
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **React** v18+, **TypeScript**, **Next.js**
- **Redux Toolkit** + **React-Redux**

## 📁 Project Structure
- `pages/` → Page components  
- `components/` → Reusable UI  
- `layouts/` → Layout components  
- **useState version** → local state  
- **Context API version** → `context/CountContext.tsx`  
- **Redux version** → `store/store.ts`

## ✅ Best Practices
- Keep components small & focused  
- Use **TypeScript** for type safety  
- Separate state from UI logic  
- Follow **Redux Toolkit** patterns  
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders
